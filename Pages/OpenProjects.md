# Open Projects

Currently, we provide open projects in the following directions.

## 1 - Domain-specific Compiler

<!-- - **Description**

We want to introduce the following 3 domain-specific MLIR dialects in the buddy compiler: Digital Image Processing (DIP), Digital Audio Processing (DAP), and Point Cloud (PC). Participants can choose 1~2 operations in a specific dialect to contribute. All projects in this direction will have a similar workflow.

(1) Data Structure Definition: Participants should add domain-specific data structure to interoperate with MLIR memory reference C/C++ data structure. For example, the MemRef constructor can work with OpenCV's Mat data structure (see [here](https://github.com/buddy-compiler/buddy-benchmark/blob/main/include/Utils/Container.h#L43) for more details).

(2) Operation Implementation: Participants should define their chosen operations in the specific dialect and implement their respective lowering passes using MLIR.

(3) Evaluation: Participants should register their created operation's use case in buddy benchmark and evaluate end-to-end cases against SOTA works in their respective domain. For example, we compare the Buddy Corr2D and OpenCV Filter2D in our benchmark framework (see [here](https://github.com/buddy-compiler/buddy-benchmark/tree/main/benchmarks/ImageProcessing) for more details). -->
